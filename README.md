# Cryptocurrencies
## Project Overview
In this project we have been tasked with creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are currently on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system so that our client, Accountability Accounting, can feel confident in offering a new crypto investment portfolio for their customers. 

The following steps were taken to accomplish this task.
- Preprocessed the Data for PCA
- Reduced Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustered Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualized Cryptocurrency Results

## Results
**1)** After preprocessing our dataset for PCA, the list of avaialble cryptocurrencies was narrowed down to 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.

**2)** The PCA algorithm was utilized to reduce the principal components of our tradable cryptocurrency DataFrame down to 3

**3)** The K-means algorithm was utilized tocreate an elbow curve in order to find the best value for K from the DataFrame that was created during the previous step. Then, the K-means algorithm was used again to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data.

**4)** 3D & 2D scatter plots were used to visualize our findings and display the distribution of our cryptocurrency clusters.
